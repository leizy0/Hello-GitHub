I have used LaTeX to typeset documents in my homework and in daily life. So, the first thing I concerned are differences between Markdown and other formating tools. Then, where're the advantages and disadvantages of Markdown. Finally, why GitHub choose it as general syntax for formatting in its platform? But before I can answer these questions, I need to know Markdown well at first.

# What can Markdown do?
There are some basic tasks that Markdown can deal with, such as:

1. Change text's style
2. Insert images stored on web
3. List like this one
4. Create titles (headers)
5. Quotes
6. Web links
7. Format code and highlight syntax elements
8. task list
9. emoji?
10. link to people
11. ...
